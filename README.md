# Attitude-control 
Small departures in yaw-pitch-roll angles have been considered for a satellite orbiting earth in a circular orbit. Gravity gradient torque is the only perturbation considered and the nonlinear equations of motions are linearized along the orbit frame for 0 euler angles. The linearized state space model is evaluated and to be unstable, the LQR control is implemented and its step response is analysed. LQR control is implemented for the nonlinear system and found to converge to the equilibrium state as shown.
