# Attitude-control 
Small departures in yaw-pitch-roll angles have been considered for a satellite orbiting earth in a circular orbit. Gravity gradient torque is the only perturbation considered and the nonlinear equations of motions are linearized along the orbit frame for 0 euler angles. The system is unstable and therefore an LQR controller is implemented in MATLAB to stabilise the spacecraft.
